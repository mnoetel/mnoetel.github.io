# Main

## Michael Noetel, PhD {#title}

### **Academic and High Performance Psychologist**

With my work, I want to do the most good that I can. Through my career, I want to help others do the same. For those who want to improve the world, I provide the knowledge and skills so they can do it best. I use methods like systematic reviews and meta-analyses to try and figure out the best approach to problems. Then I use online educational interventions to deploy those approaches cost-effectively, at scale. I use theory and evidence to make those interventions compelling, time-efficient, and effective.

**Summary of Teaching**

I use evidence-informed decision-making both in the content of what I teach and in the process of how I teach. I teach students how to think critically using evidence, and I build professional skills supported by systematic reviews. I use the same philosophy in my own teaching, using pedagogical approaches supported by top level evidence. I lead others to follow this approach, both through collaborations and coaching programs I established.

*Leadership*

-   Led or mentored lead for 6 university teaching development grants (totalling \$134,750)
-   Co-founded [INSPIRE](https://www.inspiretoolkit.com.au/), a world-first evidence-centre for learning and teaching in universities. We create, curate, and disseminate evidence for what works in higher ed.
-   Program director (Academic) for the Master of Psychology Program since 2023.

*Accolades*

-   Received 9 awards for teaching including an [AAUT](https://www.universitiesaustralia.edu.au/policy-submissions/teaching-learning-funding/australian-awards-for-university-teaching/), a [SFHEA](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/senior-fellowship), and a [VC's Award](https://staff.acu.edu.au/our_university/learning_and_teaching/grants-and-awards/citations-and-awards/vc-teaching-awards)
-   Average student evaluations of learning and teaching of 4.8 / 5 after 2,390 students

**Summary of Research**

I have research experience on large projects with many stakeholders, complex issues, and international research teams. To meet those challenges, I use best-in-class research management processes to do rigorous, impactful, and reproducible work (e.g., Asana, [Agile](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01184-9) research, Scrum). I use my subject matter expertise in leadership and high performance psychology to help my teams to do high-performance research.

*Grants*

-   Chief investigator on \$3,694,120 of competitive Category 1 grants
-   Average yearly grant income over 3x higher than the sector weighted benchmark
